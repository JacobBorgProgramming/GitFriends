# About

### GitFriends is a software developer-centric networking platform where users get to script their own profiles using modern web technologies.

While GitFriends' users do need to abide by our and GitHub's content policies, users here have more freedom and creativity than any other networking platform created. Users not only get the opportunity to contribute the code that makes up their profiles, but they get to style it and make it their own.

### So what are you waiting for? Time to Git some friends!
